Deciding whether or not to include the video player
  Pros:
    Gives the users feedback if for example a video isn’t available in their country
    Allows users to view the player if they want
    User can actually control seeking and fullscreen themselves if they want
  Cons:
    No current fullscreen support, this could look real messy
    Potentially more time than it’s worth

  Overall:
    Going to be keeping the video player. Being able to pause, change the volume and full screen is invaluable, so I’ll be keeping it in
