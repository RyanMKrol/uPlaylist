Deciding whether or not to include the video player
  Pros:
    Gives the users feedback if for example a video isn’t available in their country
    Allows users to view the player if they want
    User can actually control seeking and fullscreen themselves if they want
  Cons:
    No current fullscreen support, this could look real messy
    Potentially more time than it’s worth

  Overall:
    Going to be keeping the video player. Being able to pause, change the volume and full screen is invaluable, so I’ll be keeping it in

Deciding whether to use JQuery UIs switchClass method:
I was going to use this, but it made my button do a really weird intermediary
transition. Just using my own switch remedies this 

I appear to hash the joined IDs of all of the song IDs, for the sake of checking 
if there has been any change to the playlist later on. I think that this is fairly
redundant though as a list of IDs will be in itself, unique.
	I guess it has one benefit of being smaller to store, and easier to compare.
